            It is perhaps world's first ever, most accurate, most user-friendly, AI-powered platform designed to empower individuals to calculate, understand and reduce their own carbon footprints through answering just a few of questions regarding their day to day activities, which even a 5+ child can use.<br></br><br></br>
  
Apart from this, it also has the following features:-<br></br><br></br>
🌳 Very Accurate AI Carbon footprint Calculation along with a creative graph.<br></br><br></br>

🌳 Did You Know?- This feature, visible at the bottom of the main Question & Answer tab seeks to part and improve your knowledge(facts) about Carbon in the global scenario.<br></br><br></br>



🌳 Offset Options- It is an extremely important component that can be used to offset the emission caused by us and one of the natural ways to do so is by planting more trees. We all have learnt in our junior schools about it. Therefore based on the Carbon Footprint, it tells the person how many trees he/she will have to plant to offset it. However there are people, who would not want to plant it themselves for some reasons like inadequate space, lack of time, lack of maintainance and lack of will, and it is for them that we have introduced a feature where people, if planting by themselves, can plant under the guidance and supervision of a reputed authority which provides them a certificate on successful planting or if they want they can give Carbon Credits to an NGO to plant and maintain a certain number of trees on behalf of them, in their respective area.<br></br><br></br>

🌳 Report & Offset Proof Submission and Blockchain Verificaion- The monthly calculated report can be easily printed by Ctrl+P or by selecting the option from the ⋮(top-right). Then on clicking the Send My Report & Offset Proof button it prepares a message, which must be read and filled up properly along with attaching the report and the Offset proof for the month, which may include the certificates from the authority or the bill from the NGO, and finally send it to us. Once the mail reaches us, it undergoes a strict verification process (both by blockchain techniques & manually), after which we update the status on our database for a better administration.<br></br><br></br>

🌳 Carbon Reward Points & Leaderboard-Based on the monthly inputs sent and verification, users will be provided Carbon Reward Points which they can redeem and purchase any eco-friendly or carbon-friendly item from anywhere on Earth they wish to. Also adding to the glory, a leaderboard will be set up soon based on the top Carbon Warriors of the previous month, which would not only provide people fame, but also tend to inspire millions to join the race in saving the world.<br></br><br></br>
🌳 Correction Factor- To ensure an even more accurate result, we introduce yet another amazing feature named "Correction Factor". We invite all the experts from reputed industries and authorities to try our app and compare the calculated footprint on our app with the data their sensors generated or from their own mathematical and scientific calculations, and present any anomalies or abrasions in the results to us, by clicking on the "Report Correction Factor" button. On submitting a detailed report with adequate proof and information, we shall soon review it and if there is (really) any noticable deviation between the true findings and our findings, we shall try to improve our neural network to obtain even more accurate results of for our project by using a Correction Factor and make the platform even more powerful and effective.<br></br><br></br>
🌳 AI Chatbot plugin- This is the plugin version of our specially designed LLM powered chatbot, which is integrated on the documentation page as well as on the AI Carbon Footprint Manager interface at the bottom right corner. It is finetuned to answer all types of questions related to carbon footprint, reduction of carbon emission, and on topics related to environmental conservation. Thus, it can help to generate new, innovative, unique, and creative ideas, choices and suggestions and present it to the users, based on their data to reduce their Carbon Footprint and other tasks as well.
